module1:

vid1: tracing basics 
1.i learnt that tracing is the practice of keeping logs of activities or operations performed by a program.
2.purpose:it stores the information ,operation and we can review it at any point of the time
changes:asked "what is meta data?explain with example" adn "define the term trace?explain in simple terms".

vid2:types of runs
1.There are different types of code execution runs, such as streaming and normal (basic) calls,tool calling.
2.purpose: Different run types can be used for different operations depending on the context and requirement.
chhnages:askede"to name a new born baby"and tool calling made to perfrm xor operation.

vid3:alterantive ways to trace
1.There are alternative ways of tracing in LangSmith:Using @traceable decorator (default method),Wrapping a run tree Using trace() functionLearned when and how to apply each method effectively.
2. Purpose:To understand what type of trace is suitable for different scenarios.
chnages:asked "what does tracing with wraping explain?" and "what is run tree"

vid4:threads
1. What I learned:Threads are a way to group multiple traces together.Useful when sending two (or more) related prompts so that the LLM understands the context between them.
2. Purpose:To maintain connected conversation context across multiple related operations.
chnages:"How can I add tags to a Trace?" and "How do I add metadata to a Trace?"

module2:
vid1:Dataset
Concept: A dataset is a collection of data points, usually consisting of questions and their corresponding outputs.
Purpose: It helps to evaluate and test LLM applications by providing known inputs and expected outputs.
Changes: Added a new example for the GOAT question: Question: “What does GOAT stand for?” Output: “Ajith sir is GOAT (Greatest of All Time).”
source code:set:https://github.com/MAT496-Monsoon2025-SNU/adithya_langsmith_2410110110/blob/main/module_2/module_2/dataset_upload.ipynb

vid2:Evaluators
Concept: Evaluators determine the performance of your application. They compare the dataset examples against the outputs generated by your app.py.
Changes: Added random sample inputs and sample example runs to test the evaluator.
source code:https://github.com/MAT496-Monsoon2025-SNU/adithya_langsmith_2410110110/blob/main/module_2/module_2/evaluators.ipynb
tweaked code:https://github.com/MAT496-Monsoon2025-SNU/adithya_langsmith_2410110110/blob/main/tweaked_2/evaluators.ipynb



vid3:Experiment
Concept: An experiment runs your application on a dataset, evaluates performance, and provides results, usually in percentages or scores showing accuracy or effectiveness.
Changes: No major changes were required because the experiment was already working with the modifications I had made in the code. Essentially, it was running the dataset in different forms to compare which operations were faster or slower. Additionally, I implemented a safe evaluation method using evaluate() on a specific data split.
code:https://github.com/MAT496-Monsoon2025-SNU/adithya_langsmith_2410110110/blob/main/tweaked_2/experiments%20(1).ipynb



vid4:Analyzing Experiments
Concept: Using the LangSmith UI, you can compare different experiments, on different datasets or with different application versions, to identify areas for improvement.
Usefulness: Helps in tracking trends in application performance over time as you improve the model or prompts.
changes:no source code to make changes it was only explantion of the topic .
code:no code was there in video lecture only explanation .



vid5:Pairwise Evaluation
Concept: Compares two evaluations head-to-head, instead of looking at one by one. This helps determine which prompt or method produces better results.
Changes: Modified the “good prompt” to generate summaries of ~15 sentences. Modified the “bad prompt” to generate summaries under 10 words. Checked pairwise evaluation to see if the outputs change; no significant change was observed.

vid6:Summary Evaluator
concept:A summary evaluator assesses the quality and accuracy of generated summaries by comparing them against reference texts or evaluation metrics. 
purpose:it measure how well the model captures the key information while maintaining coherence and relevance.
Changes: No changes were made. I didn’t make any changes because doing so would have required altering many parts that I wasn’t fully clear about. However, I did understand the concept.
code:https://github.com/MAT496-Monsoon2025-SNU/adithya_langsmith_2410110110/blob/main/tweaked_2/summary_evaluators.ipynb





Concept: Provides a high-level summary of evaluation metrics after analyzing lower-level results.
Changes: No changes made.
code:https://github.com/MAT496-Monsoon2025-SNU/adithya_langsmith_2410110110/blob/main/module_2/module_2/summary_evaluators.ipynb
