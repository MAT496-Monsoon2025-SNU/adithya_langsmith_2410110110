learnt:i learnt what is lang graph, basically it is used for control flow of the llm model to process. lang graph helps it run smoothly and makes sure everything is working safely.

vid2:simple graph
learnt: i learnt how to build the graph through coding and what basic components are needed for it.
changes: i added a new node 4 with a state similar to the other nodes, and it decides which path to take. earlier it started from node 1, but now it can choose between node 1 and node 4, where node 4 directly leads to the end.
