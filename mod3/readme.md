ADITHYA CHIGULLAPALLY :

vid1:playground 
learned: Learned about the usage section of the LangSmith Playground. explored how changing prompts affects responses for example, comparing default prompts with historical contexts like the era of Parashurama or during chandrabose . Also went through a code example that creates a dataset
changes:created dataset about_adithya with basic Q&A examples.

vid2:prompt hub
learned:i learned about the prompt hub section, which helps us save prompts that are normally passed to the code. i learned how we can create prompts using langsmith, how to pass them to code, and how to update prompts whenever needed, save those updates, and manage them,how to pass a prompt to the prompt hub in langsmith through hardcoding.
changes: in the video he passed a pirate of 1600s, which i didnâ€™t change, i only made it 1200s. the major changes while passing the prompt to langsmith were a fitness tutor and a maths helping agent which solves questions. these two were the major changes and then they ran the code.
